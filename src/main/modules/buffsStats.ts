// buffsStats.ts — THE ONE OBSERVED-DURATION LEARNER (JOS-140), and the per-line game knowledge
// beside it: the mined duration samples, the recency map, and the authoritative spell DB.
//
// This is GAME knowledge, not character state — a spell's duration and its cast messages are
// identical across a character rebirth — which is why the module's rebirth/session-gap clears
// deliberately leave everything here intact (see BuffsModule.onEvent).
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// ONE LEARNER, TWO HALVES OF THE MODEL (JOS-140 ruling 1). Before this ticket there were two
// systems: buffs and debuffs had `estimateFor` and crowd control had NOTHING — the CC half was
// DB-STATED by design and said so in its own header, so a Mesmerization VII that really runs 44 s
// counted down from the base rank's 24 s and no number of casts could ever teach it (JOS-126's
// measured root cause: not a broken learner, a missing one). The CC holds now mint into THIS store
// through the same `pushSample`, and read back through the same `estimateFor`.
//
// KEYED ON (LINE, CASTER) — ruling 4, and both halves of the key are the owner's:
//   * the LINE is the rank-stripped key, so `Mesmerization III` and `Mesmerization VII` pool. This
//     OVERRULES the investigation's A2 (which wanted per-rank keys) for a measured reason: the
//     committed spells.json has 121 rank-suffixed names and ZERO rows at rank VI or above, so a
//     per-rank key would start every upgrade back at the DB floor and re-learn from nothing on
//     every level. Pooling errs toward the longer observation, which is the direction the MAX
//     estimator is built for.
//   * the CASTER is 'self' or an allowlisted external (shared/buffTrust.ts). A duration is a fact
//     about a caster's AAs, focus items and rank; a grouped enchanter's 31-second mez and your own
//     44-second one are two answers to two questions, and pooling them gives a bar wrong for both.
//
// THE ESTIMATOR ITSELF is JOS-117's, confirmed by the owner (ruling 6):
//   estimate = max( DB baseline , max-over-recent-window of CLEAN observed samples )
// The DB base is a FLOOR and the recent observed max is an EXTENSION over it. See `estimateFor`.
//
// JOS-212 (owner ruling 2026-08-12) ADDED THE ONE WAY THE FLOOR CAN LOSE, and it is still the same
// one estimator: a below-floor observation overrules the DB base when the log CORROBORATES it —
// three clean cycles in the recency window whose top three agree within 10% (`corroboratedMax` in
// buffsShapes.ts, where the measurement behind both numbers lives). It exists because the floor's
// assumption (AA/focus only extend, so nothing is ever shorter than its base) is a claim about
// classic EQ, and this game re-tiered spells the committed scrape still describes the old way. The
// estimate then reports source 'cluster' rather than 'observed', because the two make opposite
// claims about the DB row and the UI must not tell the user "longer than the baseline" about a
// number that is shorter.
//
// WHAT JOS-180 CHANGED IS THE WINDOW, NOT THE ESTIMATOR. A sample now records whether the log
// NAMED a cause for the cycle ending (`<mob> has been awakened by <name>.`), and the recency window
// is applied once per evidence class instead of once over the pooled list — so a run of broken
// mezzes can never retire the one full-length cycle the log finally produced. The exact rule, the
// measurement behind it and the property it must not cost are on `observedWindowMaxFor`.

   * Instrument of Nife, the rogue blade coats and 57 others therefore landed, printed their sentence,
   * and opened nothing at all.
   *
   * THE DISCRIMINATOR IS `durationText === 'Permanent'`, AND `durationMs == null` ALONE IS NOT IT.
   * Measured over the committed spells.json (1,926 rows): 62 rows state `Permanent`, every one of
   * them `targetType: Self` and beneficial (58 `Beneficial`, 3 `Statistic Buff`, 1 `Damage Shield`),

   * `Unlimited`, and a handful of clock forms an older scrape could not read — admitting on the null
   * would open a permanent instance for every instant self-cast in the game. The wiki's own WORD is
   * the fact; the null is an artefact of reading it.
   *
   * IT IS THE WIKI'S WORD AND NOT A CURATED LIST, which is the same rule `spellCalmsTarget` and the
   * `ccSpell` roster already follow: a re-scrape that marks another spell Permanent gets it for free,
   * and nothing here has to be hand-maintained. `durationText` is compared verbatim — the scrape
   * writes the template field unchanged and all 62 rows spell it exactly this way.
   *
   * HONEST LIMIT, STATED HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE A READER WILL ASK. The model learns a permanent
   * buff is up only from its CAST: there is no login roster in the log and a permanent buff prints
   * no periodic reminder, so one raised before logging began is invisible until the next recast.
   * Nothing can fix that from the log alone, and the failure is in the safe direction — the window

   * The observed candidate that competes with the DB floor: the MAX over the most recent window of

   * (JOS-117, re-confirmed as ruling 6):
   *   • MAX, not median/p75. Samples are dominated by early terminations that read SHORT — a buff
   *     clicked off, a mez a nuke broke — and those never lift the max, so the max recovers a
   *     focus/AA-extended true duration that a central statistic stays dragged below (Swift Like
   *     the Wind: p75 17m50 << the 36m20 that is the real timer). It is the ONLY estimator that
   *     survives the censoring, and the censoring is severe: EQ prints the same wear-off sentence
   *     whether a mez ran its course or a nuke broke it at 2 s.
   *   • a WINDOW (the last RECENT_SAMPLE_WINDOW), not all-time. A focus effect that is later
   *     REMOVED genuinely shortens the duration; bounding the max to recent samples lets an old
   *     long observation age out so a real decrease recovers.
   *
   * Safe to trust because of the CLEAN-CYCLE rule (ruling 5, buffRounds.ts): a sample is minted
   * only from a landing that was alone in its round, on a name nothing else was holding, that
   * nothing touched before its wear-off. Every censoring boundary — zone, death, offline gap,
   * entity retirement, hygiene, a wear-off with no hold behind it — contaminates instead of
   * minting, and a re-land RESETS the clock so a refresh mints one clean cycle rather than an
   * inflated land-to-fade span.
   *
   * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * THE RULE JOS-180 ADDED, EXACTLY: **the window is applied ONCE PER EVIDENCE CLASS.** The most
   * recent {@link RECENT_SAMPLE_WINDOW} UNCENSORED samples are one window, the most recent
   * {@link RECENT_SAMPLE_WINDOW} CENSORED ones are a second window, and the estimate's observed
   * candidate is the MAX over both. A censored sample can therefore never push an uncensored one
   * out of view, and vice versa.
   *
   * WHY A CENSORED SAMPLE STILL COUNTS TOWARD THE MAX. It is a real observation, just a truncated
   * one: `<mob> has been awakened by <name>.` proves the mez was still holding one instant before
   * that line, so the span is a LOWER BOUND on the duration. Discarding it outright would hand the
   * DB floor back to exactly the spells JOS-126 was filed about — a Mesmerization VII whose rank is
   * absent from the scrape and which the player always breaks early would count down from the base
   * rank's 24 s forever, which is the bar-sits-at-zero defect. A lower bound is worth more than a
   * wrong number, and MAX is the one estimator that can accept one safely.
   *
   * WHY IT MUST NOT EVICT. The window exists for ONE purpose (above): to let an old long
   * observation age out when a duration genuinely DECREASES — a focus effect removed. A broken
   * cycle is not evidence of a decrease. It is evidence of a nuke. Under a single shared window a
   * run of them retires the only full-length observation the log ever produced, and JOS-180 is what
   * that costs, measured on the owner's own bytes: five early breaks of Dazzle IV (44 s, 115 s,
   * 14 s, 23 s, 79 s, then 100 s) drove the estimate to 100 s and evicted the 115 s reading; the
   * 15 s grace an 'observed' estimate gets then culled every hold at 115 s; the real duration is
   * 136 s, so no full cycle could ever be witnessed again and the number was frozen below the truth
   * permanently. Splitting the windows is what makes the recovery STICK once the first honest
   * 136 s cycle is minted (`modules/buffTimers.ts`'s late-join memory is what lets it be minted at
   * all): five more breaks afterwards roll the censored window and leave the 136 s standing.
   *
   * A REAL DECREASE STILL RECOVERS, which is the property the split must not cost. It takes five
   * UNCENSORED shorter cycles, exactly as it always did — censoring changes which window a sample
   * lives in, never whether it ages out of one.

   *     early) ⇒ 20m, source 'db' — the estimate must NOT collapse to 4m.
   *   • An ABOVE-base observation is a real extension and WINS. Swift Like the Wind: DB 16m,
   *     observed 36m20 in the window ⇒ 36m, source 'observed'. Mesmerization: DB 24m (the base
   *     rank's, the only row that exists), observed 44 s at rank VII ⇒ 44 s.
   * With no DB base the observed max stands alone; with neither, null.
   *
   * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * WHAT JOS-212 CHANGED — THE FLOOR IS NO LONGER UNFALSIFIABLE (owner ruling 2026-08-12, and the
   * only sanctioned change to ruling 6's estimator since it was written).
   *
   * The floor rests on ONE assumption, stated above and stated here again because it is the whole
   * of the argument: *a beneficial buff's true duration is never below its DB base, because AA and
   * focus only EXTEND.* That is a claim about the game the wiki describes. The committed
   * spells.json is a CLASSIC-ERA scrape and EverQuest Legends re-tiered spells, so for a real
   * population of rows the base is not a floor at all — it is a wrong number, and because the
   * estimator is a max, no amount of evidence could ever move it. Twenty rows on the owner's log
   * sit below their floor; a reporter's Shield of Fire drew 15:00 for a spell his own log measured
   * at 6:48 twice.
   *
   * So a below-floor observation may now overrule the floor, but ONLY when it is CORROBORATED:
   *
   *   estimate = observed max, source 'cluster'
   *      when  observed max < DB base
   *      and   `corroboratedMax(cleanWindowFor(...)) != null`
   *            — i.e. ≥ {@link BELOW_FLOOR_MIN_SAMPLES} clean samples in the recency window whose
   *              top three agree within {@link BELOW_FLOOR_MAX_SPREAD}.
   *
   * buffsShapes.ts carries the measurement the two constants come from: the clustered spells
   * (Celerity 0.3% … Tashina 8.6%) and the click-off spells (Quickness 12.2% … Invisibility 161%)
   * separate cleanly, and the threshold sits in the gap. INVISIBILITY STILL KEEPS ITS FLOOR — the
   * floor law's own worked counterexample survives the change that relaxes it, which is the test
   * that the relaxation is honest.
   *
   * TWO SMALL EXACTNESSES. (1) The number the overrule returns is the whole window's max, not the
   * clean cluster's — if a CENSORED sample in the window is longer, the log proved the spell was
   * still running at that instant and the estimate may never be drawn below a proven lower bound.
   * It errs long, which is the direction everything in this file errs. (2) The comparison is
   * strict, so an observation that merely EQUALS the floor changes nothing and stays 'db'.
   *
   * `source` names which won — 'observed' when a sample beat the floor, 'cluster' when a
   * corroborated below-floor cluster removed it, 'db' when the floor held.
