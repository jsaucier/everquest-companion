/**
 * THE DEATH CENSOR'S REACH (JOS-156). A mob died — which of the things we are holding did it take
 * with it? The answer is "anything that was on an ENEMY", and it takes TWO tests to say that,
 * because neither one alone covers the log:
 *
 *   • the SPELL'S CLASS. This is the half the ticket needed. The owner's charm pet and the bees it
 *     was killing all answered to "Bzzazzt", so a slow landed on one of the bees was filed with
 *     `disp: 'charmed'` — the name matched the live pet — even though the spell on it is
 *     detrimental. A disposition test alone let that row outlive four deaths.
 *   • the RECORD'S DISPOSITION. This is the half that was already there, and dropping it costs
 *     real ground: the PACIFY family (Calm, Lull, Pacify) is `Beneficial` in the committed
 *     spells.json and is cast at enemies, so it is a `cls: 'buff'` standing on a hostile. MEASURED
 *     over the full 1.47M-line log: reading class alone left those open records behind, and they
 *     later paired with a wear-off into duration samples the old code refused (Calm 33 → 35,
 *     Lull 3 → 4).
 *
 * So the reach is the UNION, applied identically to open records and active rows — which is the
 * other half of the fix, since before JOS-156 the two halves tested different things and a row
 * could be censored on one side and left standing on the other.
 *
 * `unknown-hostile` is swept alongside the named key because its inferred target is exactly the
 * mob that just died.

/**
 * THE UNWITNESSED-EXPIRY CULL (JOS-140, widened by JOS-149, unified by JOS-156).
 *
 * The owner's first case: slow a boss, then die. The wear-off line prints to a character who is
 * not there to receive it, so it never arrives and the bar squats at 0s — for ninety minutes,
 * under the hygiene cap alone. A row whose countdown ran out and whose close was never witnessed
 * is culled after its own timeout instead. It mints NOTHING: an absence of evidence is not a
 * measurement, and `sweepHygiene` has never called `addSample`.
 *
 * ONE LINE DECIDES WHO IS EXEMPT, AND IT IS `self`, NOT `cls`. JOS-140 exempted the whole buffs
 * window, on the argument that a wears-off line for a buff of yours is printed to YOU and that a
 * beneficial clock is PAUSED by an absence, so an overdue buff is more often a paused timer than
 * a lost line. Both halves of that are true of a SELF buff and neither is true of a buff on
 * somebody else. The pet fade line resolves against the CURRENT pet, so a row bound to a pet that
 * despawned can never be named by any later line; a buff on an ally prints nothing to you at all.
 * The owner's screenshot (JOS-149) is a pair of Focus Death rows at 0s on two long-dead pets,
 * which no amount of waiting could ever close, and which the startup replay raised again on every
 * launch.
 *
 * So: SELF buffs are exempt — Infinity means "no cull", leaving the hygiene cap as their only
 * long-stop, exactly as before. EVERY OTHER ROW, debuff and non-self buff alike, is culled at its
 * countdown plus `unwitnessedTimeoutMs` — 15 s for a learned duration, 60 s for a DB floor.
 *
 * THERE USED TO BE A SECOND BRANCH HERE and JOS-156 deleted it: a debuff waited its DURATION AGAIN
 * (floored at 60 s), to preserve the learner's one chance at a late correction. buffsShapes.ts
 * carries the whole argument and the owner's ruling against it; the short form is that Tashania's
 * DB row is eleven minutes, so the branch parked the owner's bar at 0s for eleven minutes after he
 * died mid-cast, and a wear-off nobody can witness was never going to arrive to correct anything.
 *
 * A row with no number at all is counting UP, has nothing to be overdue against, and keeps the
 * hygiene cap. Nothing here reads a clock, so the cull is judged on the SAME `startedTs` the
 * countdown draws — which is what makes it respect the JOS-134 offline pause automatically: the
 * pause shifts that field, and the sweep's own hold (`heldBeforeTs`) covers every buff row,
 * self or not, for as long as a log hole is unexplained.

/**
 * THE ORPHANED-RECORD REAPER (JOS-203) — the buffs half's half of the retention rule.
 *
 * THE DEFECT IT FIXES, characterized on the running model: `sweepHygiene` iterates the ACTIVE map,
 * and its unwitnessed cull deletes the active row while deliberately KEEPING the open record
 * (JOS-156's refinement — the record is what lets a late wear-off still mint a sample, and deleting
 * it pinned the estimate to the DB floor forever). But the long stop that would eventually collect
 * that record is inside the same active loop, so once the cull ran there was NO REAPER AT ALL: the
 * record sat in `open` for the life of the process. Two things follow, and both were measured. The
 * map grows without bound. And the next landing of that spell on a same-named mob calls
 * `openRecord`, finds the stale record, and lands into its stale {@link OpenCast.group} — so the
 * row draws the ANCIENT landing's clock (the group's oldest) with the old count chip, which is
 * instantly overdue and is culled again before the player can read it.
 *
 * IT REAPS ONLY ORPHANS — a record with no active row behind it. A record that still has one is
 * governed by the sweep exactly as before, so no live row's life changes by a millisecond, and the
 * anti-squatting cull, the hygiene long stop and the offline hold are all untouched.
 *
 * THE SCHEDULE IS THE SHARED ONE: `learningRecordCapMs` — 3× the DB base, or the 90-minute long
 * stop when the DB states nothing to multiply. The CC half's late-join memory retires on the same
 * rule (`modules/buffTimers.ts remember`), which is the symmetry the ticket asked for.
 *
 * IT MINTS NOTHING AND SAYS NOTHING. A reap is not an observation (`dropExpired` hands the landing
 * back and this discards it), and nothing in either snapshot describes an open record — so the
 * caller does not mark the model dirty for it, and no delta is pushed for a bar nobody can see.
