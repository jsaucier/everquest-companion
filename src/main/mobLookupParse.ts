// mobLookupParse.ts — the PURE half of "what does this mob drop" (Task #63).
//
// Split out from mobLookup.ts (which imports electron `app` for the userData cache) exactly the
// way itemLookupParse.ts is split from itemLookup.ts, so the wikitext classification and the
// own-loot index are importable in the node test runner with NO electron dependency. Unit-tested
// in tests/considerWindows.test.mts against VERBATIM real wikitext.
//
// ===========================================================================
// THE MOB PAGE, as it actually is (fetched read-only from eqlwiki.com on 2026-08-03:
// "A zol ghoul knight", "A Froglok Gaz Knight", "Baron Telyx V`Zher", "The Tenderizer",
// "A giant rat", "A hill giant", "An ashenbone drake", "Key Master")
//
// Mob pages use {{Namedmobpage}} — the same `|field = value` grammar {{Itempage}} uses, so
// `templateField` is REUSED rather than re-implemented. Fields we read:
//   |name          = a zol ghoul knight        (the page's own spelling — the identity check)
//   |level         = 36-40 | 18 | 2 - 4 | 28   (a RANGE as often as a number → kept as TEXT)
//   |zone          = [[Lower Guk]] | Various
//   |known_loot    = an HTML <ul> of {{:Item}} transclusions (four shapes, below)
//   |related_quests = * [[Quest Page]] bullets, or the literal `* None`
//
// KNOWN_LOOT — FOUR verbatim shapes observed across those pages. The ONE invariant across all
// of them is the `{{:Item Name}}` transclusion; the list markup and the rarity annotation vary,
// so the parse keys off the transclusion and treats everything else as optional decoration:
//
//   (1) a zol ghoul knight / a froglok gaz knight — one <li> per line, rarity WORD + a drop-rate
//       span the wiki renders from its own DB:
//         <ul><li>  {{:Fine Steel Short Sword}}  <span class='drare'>(Uncommon)</span> <span class='ddb'>[Overall: 25.0%]</span>
//         </li><li> {{:Amber}}                   <span class='drare'>(Rare)</span> <span class='ddb'>[Overall: 5.5%]</span>
//   (2) Baron Telyx V`Zher — hand-written, NO spans at all, rarity in bare parentheses:
//         <li>{{:Pristine Studded Leather Tunic}} (Common)</li>
//         <li>{{:The Baron's Blade}} (Rare)</li>
//   (3) The Tenderizer — the rarity span is present but EMPTY (rarity simply unknown):
//         <li> {{:Kitchen Toolbelt}}          <span class='drare'></span>
//   (4) a giant rat — unclosed <li>s, rarity as a bare PERCENTAGE, and trailing prose inside
//       the field ("Does not drop coin."):
//           <li> {{:A Piece of Rat Fur}}   <span class='drare'>(18.4%)</span>
//
// So `rarity` is whatever text the page put in parentheses right after the item, VERBATIM
// ("Uncommon", "Ultra Rare", "18.4%"), and absent when there was none. It is never mapped onto a
// scale of our own — the wiki uses at least two incompatible ones (law 1).
//
// NOT A DROP LIST: a MerchantPage (Key Master) has `|items_sold`, not `|known_loot`. Reading
// that as drops would claim a vendor's stock is loot, so nothing here looks at it — a merchant
// simply comes back with no `dropsWiki`.

/**
 * Canonical identity key for a MOB name. The same rule as parser.idKey (lowercase + trim) plus
 * two folds.
 *
 * QUOTE FOLD: the log writes ``Innoruuk`s Chosen`` with a backtick, the wiki writes it with a
 * typographic or straight apostrophe, and the quest catalog uses whatever its page did. Folding
 * all three to `'` is what lets one mob be one key across the three sources.
 *
 * COPY-NUMBER STRIP — a trailing ` (N)`. That suffix is OURS, not the game's: no log line ever
 * carries it (a full-log sweep of the live log finds `(N)` only in heal amounts and skill-up
 * levels). `WorldModel.label()` (combat/world.ts) appends the spawn GENERATION when more than
 * one instance of a name has been engaged — "an elemental capturer (14)" is the 14th capturer
 * this session, not a different creature — and that label rides
 * `Encounter.lastOutTarget` → `CurrentTarget.name` → the Overview tab's `lookupMob(name)`.
 * MEASURED consequence before this strip: the dev userData cache
 * (`%APPDATA%\everquest-companion-dev\mob-knowledge-cache.json`) held ELEVEN such keys —
 * 'an elemental capturer (14)', 'a rock golem (45)', 'an elemental crusader (28)',
 * 'an elemental channeler (19)', 'an elemental visier (12)', … — and every one of them was
 * `notFound`, while all eleven base names are catalog hits carrying real drop tables. Plane of
 * Sky is where it bites: the island trash comes in same-named packs, so gen counters run high.
 *
 * A copy number is not part of an identity — loot off "an elemental capturer (14)"'s corpse is
 * that mob's loot, and the wiki has exactly one page for it. Same canonicalize-at-a-boundary
 * family as the item ` +N` strip (itemLookupParse.normalizeItemName, world-model law 2), and
 * as there, DISPLAY stays raw: callers pass the untouched name to `knowledgeFromCatalog`, so
 * the card still reads "An elemental capturer (14)".
 *
 * Only DIGITS are stripped. A parenthesized WORD is part of the name (instance tiers like
 * "(Awakened)", wiki disambiguators), so `(\d+)` is the whole rule — and it is safe against the
 * committed catalog, where zero of the 7,866 entries end in a parenthesized number.
 *
 * The cache SHAPE is unchanged, so no CACHE_VERSION bump and no purge: the old ' (N)'-keyed
 * entries simply become unreachable, and being negatives they age out under NEG_TTL_MS anyway.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT strip the leading article: "a giant rat" and "giant rat" are different
 * page titles on the wiki, and the log always prints the article, so keeping it is both honest
 * and lossless. Article-insensitive matching is a BOSS-matching rule (law 2), not this one.
