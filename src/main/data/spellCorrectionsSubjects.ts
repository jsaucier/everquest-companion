// THE SUBJECT PLACEHOLDER THE SCRAPE LOST — THE SWEEP (JOS-174).
//
// This is one drift class of the corrections overlay, and it has its own file because it is the
// only one that comes in bulk. READ `spellCorrectionsList.ts` FIRST: the evidence bar, the five
// drift classes and the idempotence rules are stated there and every entry below is held to them.
// `spellCorrections.ts` is the mechanism; this list is appended to that one and is applied by the
// same pass, in the same shape.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE DEFECT, AND WHY IT IS ONE SHAPE RATHER THAN ONE SPELL.
//
// A 0.14.0 shaman reported that Odium never appears on the debuff timer, "leveled to VI if that's
// the issue". The rank was NOT the issue and the ticket's hypothesis was wrong: `canonKey` folds
// ` VI` off a cast line and `You begin casting Odium VI.` anchors the DB's `Odium` row perfectly.
//
// What is missing is the LANDING. `castOnOtherSuffix()` (spellDb.ts) builds the cast-on-other
// table by stripping the wiki's `Someone ` subject and keying on the tail that follows it — the
// invariant half of the sentence, the half a log line ends with. The wiki writes Odium's
// third-person landing as `Target staggers under a dark curse.`, subject `Target`, so it yields NO
// suffix at all, the spell is in NO table, `<mob> staggers under a dark curse.` classifies as
// `{kind:'unknown'}`, and no `buffApply` is ever emitted. The overlay could not draw a bar because
// nothing ever told it one had started.
//
// MEASURED on the committed scrape: 242 of the 1,528 spells with a cast-on-other message are in
// that state (`Player` 58, `Target` 46, a bare possessive 28, `Soandso` 8, `Other_Player` 2, and
// the rest with the subject dropped entirely so the sentence starts on its verb). JOS-103 counted
// 68 of them from the DETRIMENTAL side and responded by SUPPRESSING the `lands` suggestion
// template for those spells, which was the honest move at the time — a guessed trigger that never
// fires is worse than an absent one — but it treated the symptom.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THIS IS A LIST AND NOT A WIDER STRIPPER, WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS FIX AND IS WRONG.
//
// Teaching `castOnOtherSuffix()` the wiki's whole placeholder vocabulary would be one edit and
// would cover all 242. `subjectCapturePattern` (shared/alertCaptures.ts) already knows all four
// tokens, so the asymmetry looks like an oversight. It is not, and the difference is the reason:
// that function emits a PER-SPELL regex, while this table is a SHARED namespace where each new
// tail competes with 648 others by table order and by the cascade's ordering above it.
//
// Two measurements, both made for this ticket against the owner's whole log (1,533,938 lines) and
// the real parser:
//
//   * 66 of the 242 restored sentences occur ZERO times in that log. Minting ~100 suffixes for
//     sentences nobody has ever observed is the awaiting-sample law's exact prohibition, and every
//     one of them would be live in the matcher, competing for real lines.
//   * A blanket widening is NOT INERT. Of the 34 restored suffixes that DO have log evidence, 32
//     sample lines classify as `{kind:'unknown'}` today — strictly additive, cannot shadow
//     anything — and TWO do not: ` looks powerful.` (Infusion of Spirit) and ` feels lethargic.`
//     (Sha's Lethargy) are already claimed by `classifySpellEmote`, which sits BELOW
//     `classifyDbBuff` in the cascade. Correcting those two would silently RECLASSIFY existing
//     lines, so JOS-174 left both out. One of them has since been admitted WITH the argument that
//     absence stood in for — see THE PRECEDENCE CASE below; the other is still refused.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE PRECEDENCE CASE: `<mob> feels lethargic.` (JOS-189).
//
// A beastlord reported that Sha's Lethargy — the level-50 slow — never reaches the debuff window
// (01KZP5B8F9GJ0J0BNCP29DH59J). It is the sentence JOS-174 named and refused, so it is the first
// entry in this file that TAKES a line from another classifier rather than adding one, and it is
// worth being clear about what was and was not in doubt.
//
// THE CASCADE ORDER WAS NEVER THE DOUBT. `classifyDbBuff` sits above `classifySpellEmote`
// deliberately and says why in its own doc comment: a line that EXACTLY matches a DB message names
// the exact spell, which is strictly more informative than a permissive emote candidate. What
// JOS-174 was missing was not a rule, it was the OTHER HALF OF THE ARGUMENT. Every entry in this
// sweep could be admitted on a count alone precisely because nothing was being taken; a sentence
// that is already parsing needs somebody to say what is downstream of the classifier losing it.
// So this entry supplies both halves.
//
//   THE COUNT. Owner log, 1,557,575 lines, parsed TWICE in one process with and without this one
//   correction: `buffApply` 106,507 -> 106,511, `spellEmote` 1,858 -> 1,855, `unknown` 141,281 ->
//   141,280. Every other kind byte-identical. FOUR lines move, and here they are, all of them:
//   `Magi P`tasa feels lethargic.` (x2) and `Vebarn feels lethargic.` go spellEmote -> buffApply,
//   and `a flighty fiend feels lethargic.` goes unknown -> buffApply.
//
//   THE FOURTH LINE IS ITS OWN ARGUMENT. `EMOTE_PET_RE` requires a CAPITALISED subject, and an
//   articled mob name is lowercase — so the family was already split, three lines going to the
//   emote learner and the fourth going nowhere, purely on whether the mob's name had "a " in front
//   of it. That is not an owner; it is an accident.
//
//   WHAT THE EMOTE PATH DOES WITH THEM, both consumers. `BuffsModule.mineForOverlay` treats
//   `spellEmote` and `buffApply` IDENTICALLY — both feed `observeMessage(text, ts, 'landing')` —
//   so the observed-message overlay miner sees exactly the same stream before and after, and that
//   is the half most easily missed. The only other consumer is `onSpellEmote`, which names the
//   SUBJECT of the player's own pending cast once the same text has been seen twice inside a five
//   second window. That is a cast-target DISCRIMINATOR, and what replaces it here is a landing
//   bound to the named entity outright — which is the thing the discriminator exists to
//   approximate. For this sentence the trade is not close: the owner cast Sha's Lethargy ZERO
//   times in the whole log (all 33 casts are other players'), so any pending cast of his those
//   three lines could have named a subject for was a DIFFERENT spell, and the emote was offering
//   to attribute somebody else's slow to it.
//
// ` looks powerful.` (Infusion of Spirit) IS STILL REFUSED, and the same measurement is why the two
// are not the same case. It occurs 15 times whole-log, TWELVE of them on player names and three on
// a mob, arriving in same-second PAIRS of players — the shape of a group buff landing, which is
// exactly the shape the emote learner's cast-target discrimination is for. No report names it, the
// owner is not the shaman casting it, and nothing in his log attaches those lines to a cast. It
// waits for a beastlord's equivalent: a user who says the bar is missing, and a log that says which
// cast each line belongs to. That is the awaiting-sample law, applied to the one sentence left.
//
// So: the registry, one measured entry per proven sentence, exactly like every other drift class.
// A future spell earns an entry by clearing the bar, not by matching a pattern.
//
// ALSO EXCLUDED, for a different reason: the rogue poison Strikes and Venoms (`begins to bleed
// profusely!`, `'s limbs move slower!`, `screams as poison burns their veins!`, …). Those lines
// are claimed by `classifyPoisonProc`, which is ABOVE `classifyDbBuff`, so restoring their subject
// would change nothing and would look like coverage. shared/poisons.ts owns that family.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE ROW THE OWNER'S LOG CANNOT WITNESS: `<mob> has been consumed in the flames of the wild.`
// (JOS-245).
//
// A druid reported that Vengeance of the Wild — the level-49 DoT — never appears in the debuff
// window (01KZSR4HQVWJKDG0NCDGZ01928, v0.21.0). The shape is this sweep's, exactly: the wiki writes
// the third-person landing as `Target has been consumed in the flames of the wild.`, so the spell
// yields no suffix, is in no table, and the live line classifies as `{kind:'unknown'}` — MEASURED
// against the committed DB, before this entry, on the reporter's own bytes.
//
// WHAT IS NEW IS THE EVIDENCE LOG. Every row above is anchored in `eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt`,
// and `hits` is a count in it. This spell has NO trace there at all: measured 2026-08-12 over
// 1,608,490 lines, the restored sentence occurs 0 times, the wiki form 0 times, the self landing
// (`You are consumed by the flames of the wild.`) 0, the wear-off (`The wild flames fade away.`) 0,
// and the words `Vengeance of the Wild` never appear in any line of any kind. The owner is not a
// druid of that level and nobody has cast it near him, so his log can neither confirm nor deny the
// sentence, and waiting for it to would be waiting forever.
//
// So this row's evidence log is the REPORTER'S SLICE, cited by report id — the same route Odium and
// the Tuyen chants use for their cast attribution, promoted here to carry the count as well, and the
// same route AGENTS.md already prescribes for a defect that exists only in somebody else's log. What
// the slice states, measured through the real parser: 3,405 lines, 7 `You begin casting Vengeance of
// the Wild VI.` casts, 6 lines of `<mob> has been consumed in the flames of the wild.` — one per
// cast, every one of them at EXACTLY +2 s (the DB's own 3 s cast time, rounded by the log's
// one-second stamp), and the seventh cast is the one the slice shows INTERRUPTED. Zero of the wiki
// form. That is a stronger cast attribution than most rows above can show, on a smaller log; what it
// cannot show is a whole-log frequency, and `hits: 0` says so rather than borrowing a number.
//
// The tail is minted, not joined, and nothing else in the DB comes near it: no other spell message
// mentions flames of the wild, and no existing suffix is a suffix of this one or has it as one
// (`tests/spellCorrectionsSubjects.test.mts` proves the second half for every row here). So the
// attribution would be `sole` on the table alone; it is `cast` because the slice shows the casts.
//
// THE BLAST RADIUS IS PROVABLY ZERO, and it was measured anyway rather than argued. The owner's
// whole log parsed TWICE in one process, with and without this one correction: 1,608,487 events
// across 56 kinds, and NOT ONE count moves. That is what a row whose sentence the evidence log has
// never printed looks like from the tripwire's side — the JOS-174 and JOS-189 rows each moved lines
// here, this one cannot, and the same measurement says so in both directions.
//
// NOT A DURATION FIX, and the difference matters (the WRONG NUMBER note in `spellCorrectionsList.ts`
// governs it). The DB states 5 ticks / 30 s and the slice's one complete cycle runs 47 s from
// landing to `Your Vengeance of the Wild spell has worn off of Lady Vox.` — eight damage ticks, not
// five, because the reporter is casting rank VI. That is the scaling-duration defect those two
// reports named, not a wrong sentence, and `SpellStats.estimateFor` is the thing that answers it: the
// DB figure is a FLOOR and a clean observed cycle raises it. This entry's job is to make the cycle
// OBSERVABLE at all — before it, there was no landing, so no instance, so nothing for the learner to
// pair the wear-off with and no bar to raise.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT EVERY ROW BELOW IS.
//
// The sentence is the WIKI'S OWN, unchanged. Only the subject token is restored, which is why the
// default attribution is `sole`: no DB message anywhere is closer to the live line (nothing else
// matches it at all — the tail is new to the table), so no other spell can be meant. `hits` is the
// whole-log count of the RESTORED shape in `eqlog_Primitive_freeport.txt`, measured 2026-08-10,
// and every one of those lines had no DB owner before this file existed.
//
// A row may override the attribution when a caster is demonstrably attached to the landing. Odium
// and the Tuyen chants are the ones here that do: their evidence is a reporter's slice, cited by
// report id, and that is the same route JOS-161 used for a song the owner never sang.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A ROW MAY ALSO JOIN A SUFFIX INSTEAD OF MINTING ONE (JOS-189), and the two shapes are held to
// different halves of the same rule.
//
// Every row above MINTS a tail: the restored sentence is new to the table, so nothing it matches
// was matching anything before and `sole` is the honest attribution. The Tuyen chant pair does not.
// All four of that family write ONE landing sentence and the scrape gave two of them `Someone` and
// two of them `Target`, so the suffix already exists and is already owned — restoring the subject
// adds CANDIDATES to a sentence the cast anchor is already narrowing, and mints nothing.
//
// That is the SAFER of the two shapes, not the looser one, and it is the same move the
// hand-derived list already makes for the twenty-four gates and for Cease/Desist/Sacred Word. No
// new tail means no new competition for any line in the log; the only thing that changes is which
// spells `admitLanding` may choose between, and it still refuses to choose without a cast. What it
// must NOT be is a PARTIAL overlap — a tail that is a suffix of an existing one, or has one as a
// suffix — because that is the case where table order silently decides which spell a line means.
// `tests/spellCorrectionsSubjects.test.mts` splits the invariant exactly there: a restored suffix
// must either be absent from the table or be byte-identical to one already in it, never in between.
