// LEVEL UNLOCKS, assembled — main's half of "what's new at this level"
// (docs/plans/levelup-whats-new.md, wave O2).
//
// NOTHING IS SCRAPED OR FETCHED HERE. Both halves are already committed and already bundled into
// the MAIN process (electron-vite inlines a JSON import — a path-relative read would miss in
// out/main/, the standing gotcha):
//   * spells.json  → the wiki's `classes` bullet list, parsed to (class, level) pairs by
//     shared/spellLevels.ts, plus the four card fields a hover needs.
//   * classes.json → `skillUnlocks` / `discUnlocks` / `disputed`, committed by wave O1.
// The renderer cannot import either (it must not reach into src/main), so this module folds them
// into the one shared wire shape and the panel pulls it once per session.
//
// THE DISPUTE RIDES ON THE ROW. classes.json states its disagreements as prose in `disputed[]`;
// a renderer that had to re-match those strings against rows would be re-deriving knowledge at
// the far end of an IPC. Instead every disputed discipline row carries the wiki's own sentence
// VERBATIM, so the panel's honesty chip is a field read, not an inference (law 1). Thirteen rows
// today — BER 2, MNK 10, RNG 1 — exactly the non-Rogue disciplines the central Disciplines page
// strikes through.
//
// CACHED FOREVER: both inputs are compile-time constants, so the fold runs once per process.
