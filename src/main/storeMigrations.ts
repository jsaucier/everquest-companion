// Persisted-settings schema migrations — "an upgrade must be clean, going back indefinitely".
//
// THE PROBLEM. `<userData>/everquest-companion-progress.json` is written by whatever build
// the user happened to be running. Builds go back to the very first commit and forward
// forever; auto-update means a user can jump many versions in one step (and the pre-rename
// `eq-tools` store is copied into this channel verbatim — see channel.ts `seedFromLegacy`,
// which runs BEFORE any of this). Every one of those files must load cleanly in the build
// running today. Before this module the app only had ad-hoc, per-reader fixups (a flat
// `overlay` folded on read, an `alertSoundMigration` stamp) — and at least one shape change
// shipped with NO fixup at all: `progress` → `byCharacter` (commit 41831cc) silently
// orphaned every pre-character store.
//
// THE SHAPE. An explicit integer `schemaVersion` INSIDE the file plus an ordered chain of
// migrations, applied once at startup before anything reads the store.
//
//   * Integer, not app semver. CI stamps versions from tags and dev runs unstamped, so
//     semver-keyed migrations (electron-store's built-in `migrations` option) fire in
//     surprising orders across channels. An ordered integer chain is deterministic: the
//     file says where it is, the code says where it must get to, the steps between are the
//     only thing that runs.
//   * Absent version ⇒ 1. That covers every store ever written before this framework, so
//     the chain starts from a single, well-defined floor.
//   * PURE runner over plain objects (`migrateStoreData`), file I/O separated
//     (`migrateStoreFile`) — the src/shared/update.ts precedent. Tests need no Electron.
//
// THE CONTRACT (this is what makes "indefinitely" real, and it lives in AGENTS.md too):
// any commit that changes a persisted shape ships a migration in the SAME commit. Never
// mutate what an old key means without a step that rewrites it.
//
// FAILURE POLICY. Startup never dies here. Every path is best-effort and logs:
//   * unreadable file  → leave it alone, no stamp (electron-store will raise its own error)
//   * unparseable file → QUARANTINE it to `<name>.corrupt.json`, then TRY TO SALVAGE it (below)
//     and only start fresh if nothing could be recovered. conf's `clearInvalidConfig` defaults
//     to false, so a truncated write (power loss mid-save) otherwise throws on EVERY read
//     forever — an app bricked by one bad byte.
//   * a step throws    → keep everything the earlier steps produced, stamp the last version
//     that fully succeeded, log, and retry the failing step on the next launch.
//   * newer than we know → see the downgrade note on `migrateStoreData`.
// Before the FIRST write of a run the original file is copied byte-for-byte to
// `<name>.v<from>.backup.json` (written once per source version — a later run never
// overwrites the pristine copy). At most one small file per schema version the machine has
// ever held: cheap insurance for a promise that has to hold forever.
//
// EVERY WRITE THIS MODULE MAKES IS ATOMIC (JOS-272). It was not: `writeFileSync` straight onto
// `<name>.json` is the ONE non-atomic write to the settings file anywhere in this app —
// electron-store's own `set` has gone through `atomically` (temp + fsync + rename) since conf 10,
// which is worth stating plainly because "add atomic saves to the store" is the obvious fix and it
// would have been a second, redundant, competing writer. What was actually missing was this
// module's own two writes and the RECOVERY below them.

//
// Owner, 2026-08-04: "duplicative settings; you should not have to enable voice in Preferences."
// `VoicePrefs.enabled` is gone from the model, the UI and every runtime gate — an alert whose
// `audio` says 'speech'/'both' now speaks, full stop. Which voice, how fast, how loud all stay:
// they are the voice's CONFIGURATION, never its permission.
//
// THIS STEP EXISTS SO THAT SIMPLIFYING A SETTING CANNOT CHANGE WHAT A USER HEARS. That is the
// whole of it, and it cuts one way only:
//
//   * The switch was ON  → nothing happens to the alerts. They spoke yesterday; they speak today.
//   * The switch was OFF → every alert def with `audio:'speech'` or `audio:'both'` is rewritten to
//     'sound'. Those alerts were ALREADY playing their pack sound (the retired gate degraded them
//     to it — never to silence), so this preserves exactly what the user was hearing. Leaving them
//     alone would have been the loud failure mode: a user who muted voice globally chose quiet,
//     and an update that made every one of their alerts start talking would be the app overruling
//     a decision it had just deleted the control for.
//
// ABSENT / MALFORMED COUNTS AS OFF, and that is not a guess: `enabled` was written by
// `normalizeVoicePrefs`, whose rule was `raw.enabled === true` — anything else already behaved as
// off, for years, in the only code that ever read it. So the test here is the same test.
//
// 'speech'/'both' → 'sound' is expressed by DELETING the key: absent `audio` means 'sound' by
// construction (shared/alertTypes.ts), it is the shape every pre-voice def has, and it is what
// keeps the share-string fingerprint of a rewritten def identical to a never-spoke one.
//
// THE `speech` BLOCK IS KEPT. It is inert on a sound-only def (no reader consults it unless the
// def speaks), and it is the user's own configuration — the phrase they typed, the voice they
// chose. Deleting it would turn a behavior-preserving migration into data loss, and re-picking

// Owner, 2026-08-05: "it should be on by default." The toast overlay shipped the day before with
// `open: false` in DEFAULT_OVERLAY_CONFIG, like the five meters — and it is not like the five
// meters. A meter is a window you open when you want numbers; the toast is invisible and
// click-through except for the few seconds a card is on screen. Off by default meant a
// celebration feature nobody would ever see. The default is now `true` (store.ts).
//
// WHY A STORED `false` IS FLIPPED, and why that is honest rather than presumptuous. A default is
// only the value for an ABSENT key, so flipping it would leave every store written since
// yesterday stuck at off — and `overlays.toast.open` is written on the FIRST launch of any build
// that touches the overlay config, not only when a user reaches for the switch. The feature is
// hours old: no stored `false` in existence is a person's decision to decline it, they are all
// yesterday's default written down. So this step rewrites exactly that value, once.
//
// WHAT IT WILL NEVER DO AGAIN. This is a one-time correction of a default, not a policy that the
// app may re-enable things. It is pinned to this one version step: a user who turns the toast off
// tomorrow writes `false` into a v9 store, this step never runs against it, and the switch stays
// where they put it. (`open` is also the toast's ONLY enable — the design's `enabled` IS the
// window's open-state, so there is nothing else here to correct.)
//
// The same commit stops READING `overlays.toast.sound` / `.volume` (the sound picker is gone —

// correct for exactly as long as the shared normalizer produced the v10 shape. JOS-31 changed that
// shape (booleans → 'auto' | 'on' | 'off'), so a step that kept calling it would silently start
// emitting a v11 block while claiming to have produced a v10 one — and the 10 → 11 step below,
// whose whole job is to read the v10 booleans and decide what they MEANT, would find strings.
// A shipped step's output is frozen; these two lines are what freezing it costs. (`=== true` is
// the original `typeof x === 'boolean' ? x : false` exactly — every non-`true` value, readable or
// not, was and is `false` here.)

// ------------------------------- 10 → 11: the graphics switches gain an `auto` state (JOS-31)
//
// A Wine user reported the celebration overlay becoming a stuck black box after a level-up
// (01KZGQZJ2HMZGRY28A7CVRG4QT, v0.7.0), which is the JOS-40 family arriving through Wine's
// compositor rather than through a driver. The fix is that the app DETECTS the prefix and takes
// the compatibility path by itself — and a two-state switch cannot express that, because it has
// no way to say "the user refused". So each switch becomes 'auto' | 'on' | 'off'
// (shared/graphicsPrefs.ts) and this step decides what each stored boolean MEANT.
//
// `false` BECOMES 'auto', AND THAT IS THE ONE JUDGEMENT IN THIS FILE WORTH ARGUING ABOUT. It is
// the same argument the 8 → 9 step made about the toast: `graphics` was WRITTEN ON EVERY LAUNCH
// that ran the 9 → 10 step, not when somebody reached for a switch, so a stored `false` is
// overwhelmingly yesterday's default written down rather than a person declining anything. Reading
// all of them as an explicit refusal would mean every Wine install that ever ran a v10 build is
// permanently excluded from the fix this ticket exists to deliver — a fix they cannot discover,
// because the symptom is that they cannot see the window that holds the switch.
//
// `true` STAYS 'on'. Nothing but a deliberate act ever wrote it, and detection must never be able
// to take a switch away from somebody who asked for it. That asymmetry is the whole step: the
// value that could only be a choice is preserved as a choice, and the value that was equally a
// choice and a default is handed to the thing that can tell them apart at runtime.
//
// WHAT THIS WILL NEVER DO AGAIN, in the 8 → 9 step's words: it is a one-time reinterpretation of a
// shape, pinned to this one version step. A user who turns a switch off tomorrow writes 'off' into
// a v11 store, and no future step gets to decide that they did not mean it.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------- salvage (JOS-272)
//
// A QUARANTINE USED TO BE THE END OF THE STORY: the file went to `<name>.corrupt.json` and the user
// came up on factory settings with every alert, character, preference and window position gone —
// and no notice, because from inside the app "the store did not parse" and "this is a fresh install"
// were the same state. The corrupt file was always the recovery; nobody could reach it.
//
// THE ONE RULE THIS SECTION IS BUILT AROUND: A SALVAGE THAT HALF-RESTORES IS WORSE THAN DEFAULTS.
// Defaults are at least a state the user can recognise and rebuild from. A store missing an
// arbitrary tail of its keys is a store where some settings came back and others silently did not,
// which is indistinguishable from the app losing them again later. So every repair below is
// LOSSLESS — it either recovers a COMPLETE object or it recovers nothing:
//
//   * BOM and trailing padding are stripped. A torn write on Windows characteristically leaves the
//     file extended with NUL bytes; NUL is not legal JSON and this app never writes one (AGENTS.md
//     forbids the byte in source, and `JSON.stringify` escapes it), so its presence at the tail is
//     evidence of the tear and never of content.
//   * A BALANCED TOP-LEVEL OBJECT PREFIX is accepted, with whatever follows it discarded. That is
//     the signature of an in-place rewrite that was SHORTER than the file it replaced: complete new
//     content, stale old bytes behind it. The prefix is a whole object or the scan fails; there is
//     no partial answer it can return.
//   * REFUSED, EXPLICITLY: closing unbalanced brackets to make a truncated file parse. That is the
//     half-restore, and it is the one repair that looks the most like a fix.
//
// And the recovered object is then VALIDATED before it is adopted: a plain object, non-empty,
// carrying at least one key that identifies it as this app's store in some era it has had, and a
// `schemaVersion` that is a whole number if it is there at all. Failing any of those, we fall to the
// pristine `<name>.v<N>.backup.json` copy — older, but complete, and written by this module itself —
// and failing THAT, to defaults exactly as before. The quarantined file is kept either way.
