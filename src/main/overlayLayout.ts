// Default overlay window placement (Task #59).
//
// Overlay windows persist their bounds the moment the user moves/resizes them, so this only
// ever decides where a kind appears the FIRST time it is opened (or after its stored bounds are
// cleared). The persisted position ALWAYS wins — see `overlayPlacement` in windows.ts, which
// prefers `cfg.bounds` and calls in here only when there are none.
//
// Layout: every kind docks to the BOTTOM-RIGHT of the primary display's work area, stacked
// upward in OVERLAY_KINDS order with a small gutter, so opening two or three overlays never
// lands one exactly on top of another. When the stack would run past the top of the work area it
// WRAPS INTO A NEW COLUMN to the left instead — with one uniform size that is exact, so no two
// kinds can ever overlap on their first open.
//
// SIZE IS UNIFORM across kinds (user decision): every overlay opens at the same width x height,
// whatever it renders. It is erring on the large side of the old per-kind values so the event
// log — the only kind that is a list rather than a handful of dense bars — is not cramped.
//
// …AND THE UNIFORM SIZE IS NOW A FUNCTION OF THE DISPLAY (JOS-119). Splitting the buff/timer
// overlay in two made a SEVENTH meter kind, which is exactly the case the old note in
// shared/types.ts warned about: seven 380x320 slots do not fit a 1366x728 laptop's work area
// under any column arrangement (three columns fit, two rows fit, that is six slots), so the wrap
// would have clamped a fourth column on top of the third and two windows would have opened
// exactly over each other. The answer is NOT to let them overlap and it is NOT a per-kind size:
// on a display that cannot hold the whole reserved grid, EVERY kind shrinks TOGETHER by the same
// factor until the grid fits. Uniformity survives, the no-overlap guarantee survives, and a
// display big enough for the full grid (anything 1080p or larger) is untouched at 380x320.

/**
 * THE FLOOR EVERY OVERLAY KIND SHARES — how small the user is allowed to drag one (JOS-278).
 *
 * 200x90 → 140x90, on a 0.23.0 report from a player who runs Lossless Scaling: a third-party
 * magnifier multiplies the overlay along with the game, so the app's own floor arrives on screen
 * at 1.5–2x the number written here and the debuff strip could not be made narrow enough to live
 * beside the spellbar. Owner ruling 2026-08-13: allow a lower minimum. A floor still EXISTS —
 * this is the promise that a window can never be dragged down to a few pixels and lost — and the
 * floor is ONE rectangle for every kind, because the widest chrome any kind wears is what the
 * number has to survive and a per-kind floor would only hide that.
 *
 * BOTH NUMBERS ARE MEASURED IN THE RUNNING APP, not chosen — tests/e2e/overlayMinSizeSteps.mts
 * re-measures them and fails if any control ever leaves the window at this size again.
 *
 *   WIDTH 200 → 140. The binding row is the HEADER: the live dot, the kind tag, the title, the
 *   drag gutter and the lock/close pair. At 140 all of it is inside the window; below 140 the
 *   CLOSE control starts leaving it, which is the one control you cannot get back from inside.
 *   140 needs the two give-way rules that ship with this change (overlay/OverlayHeader.tsx: the
 *   drag gutter and the kind tag shrink) and the footer WRAP beside them (overlay/overlayScale.tsx
 *   `FOOTER_ROW`).
 *
 *   HEIGHT 90 → 90, AND THAT IS THE FINDING. The old 90 was a guess that happened to be right:
 *   measured, the buffs window's footer needs 88px of window to keep A− / A+ off the bottom edge
 *   at 140 wide, so 90 is two pixels of margin over a real limit rather than a round number. What
 *   90 is NOT is "one row of content" — at 90 the scrolling pane is 8px, i.e. its own padding and
 *   nothing else. This floor is about REACHING a window, never about reading it; the height that
 *   makes a timer list useful is the user's to choose, well above here.
 *
 * WHAT THE OLD FLOOR WAS ACTUALLY DOING, since it is the reason the width could move at all: at
 * 200x90 the buffs, debuffs and XP windows already had their text-size stepper OFF THE SCREEN
 * (measured at x=237, 233 and 216 against a 200px window). The floor was not too small for the
 * chrome — the chrome had no way to give, so it ran off the edge. Wrapping is what makes a
 * narrower floor honest, and it is what fixes the old one on the way past.
 *
 * The content itself imposes nothing: bars, feed rows and timers ellipsize their names and the
 * pane scrolls, so at the floor they truncate rather than overlap.
