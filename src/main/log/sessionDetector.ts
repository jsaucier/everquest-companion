// Offline-gap detection (login/logout in the world model) — the sibling of epochDetector.ts,
// and wired the same way: index.ts subscribes it to the bus AFTER the modules and the combat
// engine have folded each event, and it hands its synthesized `offlineGap` back onto the SAME
// bus via `bus.emitDerived` (the Task #47 derived path). The bus drains derived events after
// the primary one finishes reaching every listener, so consumers see the `sessionStart` line
// first and the gap it implies second. Replay and live are IDENTICAL — nothing here reads the
// wall clock, so a rescan reconstructs every historical gap for free.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE MEASUREMENT THAT SHAPES THIS FILE (real log, 1,152,483 lines, 2026-08-03).
//
// The obvious rule — "fromTs is the last event before the Welcome" — DOES NOT WORK, and
// fails silently rather than loudly. Every login prints a RECONNECT PREAMBLE *before* the
// `Welcome to EverQuest Legends!` line, because the client is already connected to the chat
// servers while the character is still being placed in the world:
//
//   [Fri Jul 31 01:05:43] It will take you about 30 seconds to prepare your camp.   ← logout
//   [Fri Jul 31 01:06:07] It will take about 5 more seconds to prepare your camp.
//   [Fri Jul 31 14:49:09] You are not currently assigned to an adventure.           ← preamble
//   [Fri Jul 31 14:49:13] Channel General was too full to join
//   [Fri Jul 31 14:49:13] Channels: 1=General1(400)
//   [Fri Jul 31 14:49:15] Welcome to EverQuest Legends!                             ← login
//
// Measured across ALL 19 logins in the log, the newest event before the Welcome is 0–2
// seconds older than it — every time, without exception. A last-event anchor would have
// reported that 13h43m absence as SIX SECONDS and would have emitted zero gaps, ever.
//
// Classifying the preamble instead was considered and REJECTED: it is not a closed set. The
// burst also carries other players' CHANNEL CHAT (`Ankhos tells NewPlayers:1, '…'` lands one
// second before the Jul 19 15:30:24 Welcome), which is ordinary chat by every other measure.
//
// So the anchor is a MEASURED WINDOW. `fromTs` is the newest event at least
// RECONNECT_WINDOW_MS older than the Welcome. The complete preamble fits inside 22 seconds in
// 19/19 logins (longest: Jul 19 22:12:49 → 22:13:01), so 30s clears every observed one with
// margin while staying far below the 60s emit threshold. This is the same species of constant
// as the model's other measured windows (the ~5s encounter linger of law 7, the ~2.5s clicky
// window) — derived from the log, not chosen.
//
// The cost is honest and bounded: `fromTs` is a LOWER bound on the absence. Up to 30s of real
// in-world time immediately before a logout is discarded, so every reported gap is at most
// 30s SHORTER than the truth. Nothing downstream may treat it as exact — see the mining
// censor in buffsInstances.ts, which drops (rather than adjusts) any duration sample that
// spans a gap precisely because of this.
//
// VERIFICATION of the whole rule against the 19 real logins: 15 gaps emitted (2m15s … 183h),
// 4 suppressed (30s / 31s / 31s / 34s — all genuine sub-minute relogs); `camped` true for 17
// and false for the 2 crashes (Jul 28 13:37, Jul 31 22:07), matching a hand read of the log.
