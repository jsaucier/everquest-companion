   * NOT `this.offset`, and the difference is the whole reason this method exists. `offset` is how
   * far the tailer has READ, which includes a trailing partial line the game has not finished
   * writing; that line has been emitted to nobody. A checkpoint claims "the state in this file is
   * `fold(bytes [0, b))`", so `b` must be exactly where the emitted lines stop — the same
   * definition `ScanResult.endOffset` uses, and the same reason it uses it.
   *
   * `leftover` is decoded text, so its BYTE length is what comes off, not its character length: a
   * partial line containing a non-ASCII name would otherwise leave `b` pointing mid-character and
   * the shoulder hash would be computed over bytes no line boundary sits on.
   *
   * THE SIBLING ABOVE IS THE OTHER ANSWER, AND THE TWO MUST NOT BE SWAPPED. `readOffset()` (JOS-57)
   * is the READ cursor, and the cold-read delta wants exactly that — how many bytes nobody has
   * read. This one is where the FOLD's knowledge stops. They differ by at most one partial line,
   * which is nothing to a byte-count bucket and is a wrong `b` to a checkpoint.
