// prefsSnapshot.ts — WHAT THE PREFERENCES PANE KNOWS, AND HOW IT LEARNS IT (JOS-340).
//
// The DOM-free half of the pane's hydration. ./prefsHydration.tsx is the React half — the gate,
// the context and the seed hook — and it re-exports everything here, so a card imports one module
// and never has to care which side of the line a symbol lives on. The split is combatPrefs.ts /
// useCombatPrefs.ts's exactly: the vocabulary goes somewhere a node test can reach it, and the
// storage half keeps the browser.
//
// WHAT THE CACHE IS FOR. The gate makes the pane wait for one batched read. That would be a wait
// on EVERY mount — and the section rail is a switcher, so a user pays it on every rail click — if
// the answer were not kept. It is kept for the renderer's life, so the gate is cold exactly once
// and every later mount seeds synchronously from memory. Read ./prefsHydration.tsx's header for
// why this is a gate at all rather than a synchronous preload snapshot.
//
// AND IT IS KEPT CURRENT BY THE WRITES, WHICH IS THE HALF A PRELOAD SNAPSHOT COULD NOT DO. Every
// card takes main's REPLY as authoritative (the handlers re-clamp through the shared normalizers)
// and hands that same value to `recordPref`. So the cache holds what is on disk, and a remount
// after a change seeds from the change rather than from what the pane loaded minutes ago.

// The one value import here is deliberately RELATIVE, not `@shared/*` — repo law for a module
// that has to load under a plain node test (the mobSearch.ts precedent). Type-only imports may
// keep the alias, and do.
