// TextSizeSetting — Preferences → Text size (JOS-123).
//
// A player on v0.13.0 wrote "Please allow us to enlarge the text. I can barely read it." This is
// the answer for the MAIN window; the floating overlays got theirs in an earlier round and keep
// it (the A− / A+ stepper in their own footer), which is why the caption says so out loud. Someone
// who came here to fix their meters and left thinking nothing happened would be the one way this
// card can fail.
//
// FIVE BUTTONS, NOT A SLIDER. The ladder lives in shared/uiScale.ts with the reasoning; what
// matters here is that a person who cannot read the screen should not have to aim at a 4px track
// to make it bigger. Every stop is one press away, the current one is lit, and the labels are
// percentages because that is the vocabulary browsers taught everybody.
//
// IT APPLIES ON THE PRESS. Main stores the value and zooms the live window in the same call, so
// the button you just pressed is being read at the size it chose. That is the whole evaluation
// loop for a setting like this, and it is why there is no "restart to apply" sentence anywhere in
// here (compare GraphicsSetting, whose switches genuinely cannot).
//
// STATE, NEVER PROCESS, AND THE CAVEAT DIET (AGENTS.md): one caption, two plain sentences, no
// explanation of zoom factors or device pixels.
//
// ONE BORDER: PreferencesView already wraps each item in an outlined Paper, so this renders a bare
// Stack.

/**

 * authoritative, being what was actually stored: the normalizer snaps to the ladder, so a reply
 * that disagrees with the request is a reply worth taking.
 *
 * IT USED TO MOUNT ON `UI_SCALE_DEFAULT` AND CORRECT ITSELF (JOS-340), and this card is where that
 * was most absurd: a person who came here BECAUSE they cannot read the screen — and who therefore
 * has the ladder somewhere above 100% — opened the section and watched 100% light up first. The
 * window was already at their size; only the control disagreed, for a frame, about what they had
 * chosen. The snapshot already holds the value, snapped to the ladder.
