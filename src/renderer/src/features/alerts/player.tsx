// AlertPlayer — an always-mounted (App-level) component that turns fired alerts
// into sound AND SPEECH, and the `fireAppSignal` entry point for renderer-side app triggers.
//
// SPEECH (docs/plans/voice-alerts.md §3, wave 2) rides the SAME firing paths, decided by ONE
// pure function — `speechPlan` in lib/speech.ts — rather than by a branch at each call site:
//   audio:'sound'  (or absent) → unchanged: the pack sound, as it always was.
//   audio:'speech'            → the utterance INSTEAD of the sound.
//   audio:'both'              → the sound, then the utterance queued behind it (D5), using
//                               soundCache's `onEnded` continuation so they never overlap.
// The alerts module's master MUTE and its volumes govern both halves: mute silences speech
// too, and the utterance is spoken at VoicePrefs.volume × this alert's effective volume. The
// engine itself (which tier, which voice, and the fact that the e2e channel never utters)
// lives entirely behind `speak()` — this file never touches speechSynthesis.
//
// Two firing paths converge here:
//   1. module:delta 'alerts' — the main-side AlertsModule fired an event/raw
//      trigger on a LIVE log event. We look up the def, respect mute, and play at
//      globalVolume × alert.volume. (Cooldown/enabled were already enforced in the
//      module; we don't re-check here.)
//   2. fireAppSignal('bossDefeat') — a renderer-only signal (main can't evaluate
//      it because it depends on derived boss state). App calls this exactly where
//      boss confetti fires. We match it against every enabled 'app' alert with the
//      matching signal, applying the SAME cooldown the module would.
//
// The player keeps a live copy of defs + prefs (hydrated on mount, refreshed on
// window focus and after any save via the shared store below) so both paths have
// what they need without prop-drilling.
