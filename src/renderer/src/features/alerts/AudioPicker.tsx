// AudioPicker — the alert row's TWO dropdowns: what this alert plays, and which one.
//
// Owner: "the voice vs sound should be integrated into this dropdown instead of having to drill
// into edit." Before this, the row showed a pack picker and a sound picker, and the fact that an
// alert could SPEAK instead lived two clicks away in the editor's Speech block — so the single
// most interesting thing about an alert ("does this one talk?") was invisible in the list where
// every other property of it is visible.
//
// THE TWO SELECTS, EXACTLY:
//   1. OUTPUT — every installed sound pack (as before), a divider, then "Voice (spoken)" and
//      "Sound + voice". Choosing a pack means `audio:'sound'`; the two voice entries mean
//      'speech' and 'both' and keep the pack/sound the def already had. The select DISPLAYS the
//      def's actual state, so a def with `audio:'speech'` reads "Voice (spoken)" — there is no
//      hidden mode a row can be in without saying so.
//   2. CONTEXTUAL — the pack's sound list for 'sound' and 'both'; for 'speech' the speak-what
//      modes as plain sentences ("Speak: alert name", "Speak: custom…"). Custom opens a small
//      popover anchored on the select itself, never a navigation: the whole point of this change
//      is that the row is where you configure an alert.
//
// WHY 'both' KEEPS ITS FINE-TUNING IN THE EDITOR. An alert has three audio dimensions (channel,
// which sound, what it says) and this row has two selects. For 'sound' and 'speech' two is
// enough — the third dimension does not exist. For 'both' it is not, so the row shows the sound
// (the thing you are most likely to change) and the editor's SpeechBlock stays the place to
// change what a 'both' alert says. The row owns the 90% case; the editor stays complete.
// The editor is also authoritative for the per-alert VOICE override, which this row preserves
// without ever authoring (audioChoice.ts) — two selects cannot show three dimensions, and
// silently dropping a voice the user chose would be the worst way to admit it.
//
// PREVIEW IS NOT REBUILT HERE. The row's ▶ routes through `previewAlertNow` → `playAlertNow`,
// whose `speechPlan` decides sound vs speech from the very fields these selects write — so a def
// switched to "Voice (spoken)" SPEAKS when previewed, through the same seam that fires it for
// real. There is no second preview path and there must not be one.
//   That claim was written here before it was TRUE: a global voice switch (retired 2026-08-04)
//   sat inside `speechPlan` and degraded 'speech'/'both' back to the pack sound whenever it was
//   off — which it was by default — so pressing ▶ on a row you had just switched to voice played
//   the old sound and looked like this picker had not saved. One seam, one path, and now one
//   pinned equality: features/alerts/preview.ts + tests/alertPreview.test.mts.
//
// LAYOUT CONTRACT (inherited from SoundPicker, unchanged): in the alert list the two Selects
// must be columns of the ROW's shared grid template (see the grid comment in AlertList), so the
// wrapper is `display: contents` and each Select takes its width from the shared template
// instead of from whichever pack/line/phrase happens to be selected — every row lands its
// selects at the same x, and each one ellipsizes its displayed value rather than growing.
