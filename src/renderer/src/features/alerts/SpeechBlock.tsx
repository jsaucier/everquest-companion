// SpeechBlock — the alert editor's SPEECH half (docs/plans/voice-alerts.md §4): which audio
// channel this alert uses, what it says, in whose voice, and whether it may be swallowed by the
// cross-alert audio throttle.
//
// Its own file because AlertDialog.tsx is already at the factoring ceiling, and because this
// block is a self-contained sub-form: `useSpeechForm` owns its four fields, `speechFieldsFor`
// turns them back into the def's optional keys, and the component is the rendering. AlertDialog
// composes the three.
//
// THE PREVIEW IS LIVE AND NEEDS NO FIRING. `speechTextFor(def, firing?)` is pure and takes an
// OPTIONAL firing precisely so this line can be resolved while the user types (W1's contract) —
// so the user reads the actual sentence, resolved by the same function the player will run,
// before ever pressing ▶. On a spell mode there is no spell yet, so the preview shows the
// alertName FALLBACK — which is the honest answer: it is exactly what they will hear whenever
// the trigger turns out to name no spell.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: rate, volume and the DEFAULT voice. Those are global (the
// Preferences → Voice section); this block only overrides. A per-alert rate would be four
// places to look when one alert sounds wrong.
