// audioChoice.ts — the PURE half of "what does this alert do when it fires", as edited from the
// alert LIST's two dropdowns (owner: "the voice vs sound should be integrated into this dropdown
// instead of having to drill into edit").
//
// The alert row shows two selects and nothing else, but the def carries FOUR things behind them:
// the audio channel (`audio`: sound | speech | both), the pack sound (`sound.packId`/`soundId`),
// what a spoken alert says (`speech.mode`/`phrase`) and — editor-only — whose voice says it
// (`speech.voiceId`). This module is the mapping between the two, kept pure and DOM-free so the
// mapping itself is node-testable: every "clicking X writes Y on the def" claim in the row is a
// function here, not a closure inside a Select.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE WRITE IS LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic. `audio` is omitted at 'sound' and
// `speech` is omitted when nothing is configured — exactly as SpeechBlock.speechFieldsFor does
// it — so an alert that never asked to speak still saves byte-identically to how it always did.
// That is what keeps every pre-voice def, every share string and the import de-duplication
// fingerprint stable (shared/alertTypes.ts: absent `audio` ⇒ 'sound', by construction).
//
// VOICEID IS PRESERVED, NEVER AUTHORED. The row cannot pick a voice — two selects cannot show
// three dimensions — so the editor's SpeechBlock stays authoritative for it. Every write here
// carries the def's existing `speech.voiceId` through untouched; a row edit must not silently
// drop an override the user set in the editor.
//
// Value imports from `shared/` are RELATIVE, never `@shared/*` — the repo-wide rule for anything
// node:test loads (AGENTS.md toolchain gotchas, the mobSearch.ts precedent). Type-only imports
// keep the alias, which is erased before Node ever sees the file.
