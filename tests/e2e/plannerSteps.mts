//   * every `planner-*` SELECTOR, so one file names the DOM and the two halves cannot drift into
//     two spellings of the same testid, and
//   * the four steps that measure THE EFFECT LIST — the era filter, the non-equippable escape
//     hatch, the focus-family fold and JOS-42's readability — which are all the same
//     measurement (how tall is the list, what is on its rows) asked four ways, plus the DOM
//     helpers that measurement needs, and
//   * the two JOS-210 steps, which are that same measurement asked about the ITEM NARROWING: does
//     it survive a kind switch (the bug), and can any item in the DB produce one (the feature).
//
// Everything downstream of "a donor has been added" — the Inventory tab, the host picker, the
// socket preset, the Farm rollup and the Loot deep link — stays in the spec, because those steps
// navigate between modes and the ordering between them IS the test.

 * Hoard is exported only while its window is open, the tradeskill depot only if it has been
 * loaded. A dump typed anywhere else is not an error and does not look like one — it is a
 * well-formed file that silently omits whole storages, which is a player's Plane of Sky weapons
 * going missing from a tab that is otherwise right (report 01KZNQK6ZSRB8SMN8D5PJ8BS28).
 *
 * So this asserts the two things that make the steps worth having: the ORDER (open the hoard
 * BEFORE typing the command — afterwards captures nothing), and the one limit no order can fix
 * (currency-tab items never dump at all). Collapsed until asked, so the click is part of the test.
