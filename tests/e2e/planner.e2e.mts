/**
 * Headless Electron integration test for the EXALTATIONS tab (docs/plans/exaltation-planner.md §9,
 * wave 3). The tab is LABELLED Exaltations since JOS-42; every id, route, store key and testid in
 * here still says `planner`, because the rename was a label and not a refactor.
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN FILE: one spec per surface, all of them sharing `appHarness.mts` and running back
 * to back from `npm run test:e2e`. `EQ_E2E=1` (src/main/e2e.ts) shows no window, skips the
 * single-instance lock and points `userData` at a throwaway temp dir, so this runs invisibly
 * beside the user's game and dev app.
 *
 * WHY `userData` IS WIPED FIRST: the first assertion is the EMPTY STATE — a character with no
 * saved sets is invited to create one. The sets live in the store and the selected set/mode live
 * in `localStorage`, both inside `userData`, so a dir left behind by an earlier run would make
 * that assertion vacuous (and would land the pane in whichever mode the last run left open).
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS, against the REAL committed item DB: the Gear nav row plus the Exaltations tab
 * mounts the pane on its empty state (JOS-324 collapsed four nav rows into one area — the door
 * changed, nothing behind it did); creating a set from the UI produces a set chip and a toolbar; the effect browser lists
 * at least one effect row and expands it into at least one donor (the corpus is committed data,
 * so this is deterministic — but it is asserted as a FLOOR, never as today's count); adding that
 * donor to the set writes a socket that BOTH other modes can see — the Board draws it in a cell
 * with a state chip, and the Farm rollup lists it under some heading; the two growing lists are
 * BOUNDED scroll boxes (the Task-#56 law); the era filter is ON by default and actually
 * removes rows when it is switched off (the corpus is majority Kunark/Velious, so "off shows
 * more" is an identity, not a number); the Focus tab opens on FAMILIES with the best tier of
 * each crowned, which is the per-socket grouping default (V4/V5) rather than a global one; a
 * majority of the donor rows on screen state what their effect DOES, in one line joined from the
 * committed spell DB (V6 — a count, never today's wording); the
 * Inventory tab either fills its hosts from a real `/outputfile inventory` dump or teaches the
 * command, never both (V7 — whether this machine has a dump is not something a spec may assume);
 * the board draws both any-slot cells, named in the client's own words, and a planned exaltation
 * says what it DOES when you hover it (JOS-104, both halves of one player's report);
 * clicking one of a host's sockets lands in the effect browser filtered to that socket, that slot
 * and that host, with a chip that can be cleared (V8); that narrowing SURVIVES a switch between the
 * effect kinds and can equally be reached from the item side, by typing any item the DB carries
 * into the filter bar's own picker (JOS-210, both halves of the owner's report); and the exaltation rules card is NOT up on a
 * first visit, comes up only from the toolbar's `?`, and closes for good when dismissed (V10 as
 * JOS-51 revised it — the rules are there when asked for, never by default).
 *
 * The one thing it deliberately does NOT assert is which effects or donors are on screen: a
 * rescrape may re-word an effect, and a spec that pins today's proc names would rot (AGENTS.md:
 * frozen numbers rot).
 *
 * Run: `npm run test:e2e`.

 * used to build "Dropped by / Zones" from OBSERVED loot events alone, so a donor you have never
 * looted answered "No source recorded" one click after the planner told you which mob drops it.
 * `loot-db-sources` is the section that closes that contradiction, so its presence is the actual
 * contract this link depends on.
 *
 * AND IT IS A ROUND TRIP (JOS-43). The reported bug was the return leg: Back on that drill meant
 * the top of the loot ledger, so reading one donor cost you your place in the plan. The arrow now
 * names the tab that sent you and goes there, which is asserted both by its accessible name
 * (before the click) and by the Exaltations tab being on screen after it.
 *
 * Runs LAST: it leaves the app on Exaltations having passed through the Loot tab, so every
 * planner-scoped measurement above it must already have been taken.
