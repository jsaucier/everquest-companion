// THE ZONE HALF of the app-wide timeslice, on the Leveling tab (JOS-130) — living next door
// because leveling.e2e.mts sits AT the repo max-lines budget and the rule here is to SPLIT, never
// ratchet (drill.mts set the precedent; dropSteps.mts, combatSteps.mts and plannerSteps.mts
// followed it). The spec still owns the ORDER, the launch and the dashboard readout it hands in.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN STEP AND NOT ANOTHER RUNG OF THE TIMESCALE ONE. Every other slice replaces
// the drawn WINDOW, and the timescale step is built on exactly that: the strip re-cuts, a stale
// selection is dropped, the hover re-maps. `Zone` does the opposite — it is the whole record
// restricted to the zone the log last named, so the curve keeps its domain and only the
// arithmetic under it moves. Asserting that asymmetry as a PAIR is the point: a refactor that
// flattened the zone filter into a time window would still pass every check over there.
//
// WHAT NO UNIT TEST CAN REACH: `tests/timeslice.test.mts` pins the definitions and the partition
// identity over a hand-built snapshot. It cannot see that the button in the real app resolves the
// real progression module's last zone line, hands one `zoneKey` down through `scopedStats` into
// `rangeStats`, and comes back to `All` with every rendered number byte for byte.
