// Class-combo fixture extractor (docs/plans/class-combo-inference.md § 11).
//
// Slices real spans out of the live log and keeps ONLY the lines that carry class evidence:
// the character's own `/who` rows (the single Tier-A observation — the only line in the game
// that states the loadout), level dings (the structural swap signal, since a displayed level
// is the MINIMUM of the loadout's class levels), casts, stances, invocations, rogue poison
// coats, and skill-ups (the only window into BER / MNK / WAR / ROG, which have 0/0/0/9 spells
// between them).
//
// Routed through the SHARED scrub (tests/fixture-scrub.mjs `scrubKeep`) like every other
// extractor: ONE definition of "third-party chat" for the whole tree, and never a hand-copied
// raw span. That is what drops all 410 strangers' `/who` rows while keeping Primitive's own
// 11 — and it is why the design document's quoted chat lines never reach a fixture.
//

// CW1 WHO-ANCHORED — Tue Jul 28 14:00:00 → 20:45:00. The densest `/who` day in the log:
// SEVEN self rows, covering all four DISTINCT anchor combos the design names — [7 CLR/BER]
// (14:11:26), [7 PAL/ENC] (14:14:48), [10 PAL/ROG/ENC] (17:25:15), [17 PAL/MNK/ENC]
// (20:16:48, plus repeats at 20:30/20:31 and [18 …] at 20:42). That is the 2→3 slot
// transition — the tertiary slot unlocks at level 10 — stated by the game itself, and it
// carries the Jul 28 Backstab + Frenzy skill-ups that place ROG and BER in the same day.

// CW2 THE UNLOGGED SWAP — Fri Jul 31 16:00:00 → the log's end at extraction (Mon Aug 03
// 15:17). Spans the ONE loadout swap in the post-launch log and, critically, the
// EVIDENCE-SHIFT WINDOW inside it: the last MNK evidence is `Feign Death! (108)` at
// Sun Aug 02 00:57:55 and the first ROG evidence is `Backstab! (2)` at 01:57:42 — one hour
// apart, with no line between them announcing anything. The wide structural bracket is here
// too: `Welcome to level 50!` at Jul 31 16:19:04 and the drop to `level 11!` at Aug 02
// 02:13:34, the honest 33.9 h boundary. Both sides need to be long enough to establish
// SUSTAIN (evidence in ≥2 hourly buckets), which is what a one-hour slice around the shift
// could not show, so the span is deliberately the full three days.
// It is the largest fixture this wave adds (~440 KB, vs the accepted 289 KB precedent of
// wl44-swap-boundary.log). It cannot be trimmed by dropping evidence-free stretches: after
// the KEEP filter EVERY retained line is evidence, and thinning it would manufacture a
// sustain gap the real session never had.

// CW3 CLR/PAL AMBIGUITY — Tue Jul 28 13:41:00 → 14:41:00 (the design's "14:11 ±30 min").
// The `[7 CLR/BER]` anchor and the window around it, where every cast the character makes is
// a {CLR,PAL} shared spell (Reckless Strength, Wrath, Smite, Furor, Center, Courage, Daring,
// Stun, Holy Armor). CLR is NEVER exclusively evidenced anywhere in this log, so cast
// evidence alone can only ever report the SET {CLR,PAL} — never a guess of PAL.
// NOTE for the module wave: this span contains TWO self `/who` rows ([7 CLR/BER] at 14:11:26
// and [7 PAL/ENC] at 14:14:48). They are the ground truth the ambiguity is measured against,
// but they will also ANCHOR the interval at provenance 'who' — so the "stays ambiguous"
// assertion belongs on the scorer's own output (observations → slots), not on a /who-anchored
// interval.
slice(177648, 185280, 'cw3-ambiguous-clr-pal.log')

// CW4 THE STRAY CAST — Sun Aug 02 18:00:00 → 21:00:00, deep inside the post-swap PAL/ROG/BER
// period. Exactly ONE cast in the whole window names a class the loadout does not have:
// `You begin casting Rampage I.` at 20:52:33, which spells.json maps to {ENC}. One cast in
// one hourly bucket must NOT admit ENC (the sustain ≥ 2 rule).
// THE DESIGN NAMES THE WRONG LINE: § 2/C1 and § 10 call this "the lone Chaos Flux". There is
// no player Chaos Flux cast on Aug 2 at all — the only Aug 2 occurrences are a MOB's
// (`A ghoul scribe begins casting Chaos Flux.` 19:37:27 and its interrupt), which the parser
// never turns into a castBegin. Rampage I is the real instance of the case the design
// describes, and it is inside the span the design already chose.

// CW5 THE WIZARD SWAP — Tue Aug 04 00:00:00 → the log's end at extraction (Thu Aug 06 22:38).
// The JOS-79 window, and it needs all three days for a reason the other fixtures do not:
//   * Aug 04 00:00 – 20:57 is the tail of the PAL/ROG/BER era, and 20:57:35's `Welcome to level
//     50!` is the ding that OPENS the level-drop window the bug lives in.
//   * Aug 04 23:38:01 is a swap into ENC/MNK/PAL that the game never dinged for (all three were
//     already capped), so only the evidence shift dates it.
//   * Aug 06 19:31:23 dings NON-INCREASING — the swap into a wizard loadout, whose window
//     therefore reaches all the way back to Aug 04 20:57:35 and swallowed the shift above.
//     Two real swaps, 43.9 h apart, arriving as ONE boundary. The fixture is the whole shape.
//   * Aug 06 19:31 → the end is the wizard evening itself: `Shock of Lightning` at 19:31:49,
//     `Lightning Bolt`, `Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock` — 824 wizard-exclusive observations that
//     the old clicky-suppression rule discarded to the last one, because this character casts
//     under a Spell Haste II focus that shimmers in the same second as every cast.
// Cannot be trimmed to the evening alone: the departure half of the reinstatement test needs
// MNK sustained BEFORE the ding, and the shift at Aug 04 23:38 needs BER/ROG sustained before
// IT — thinning either side would manufacture a silence the real session never had.

// CW6 THE WHOLE ARC — Tue Aug 04 00:00:00 → the end of Sun Aug 09. CW5's span with the SWAP BACK
// on it, and the reason it exists is that CW5's right edge is the blind spot that let JOS-79's
// guard die silently (JOS-239).
//
// CW5 stops inside the wizard evening. `reinstatedDrops` asks whether a class DEPARTED across the
// absorbed ding, and its window runs to the end of the observations — so inside CW5 the monk is
// gone and the guard fires, while on the LIVE log the owner swapped back and MNK/ENC return, so
// nothing departs, the Aug 06 19:31 cut is never reinstated, and one 4.5-day interval swallowed
// two swaps. The fixture passed the whole time. A regression guard whose window ends before the
// evidence that breaks it is not a guard.
//
// What the span carries, in order:
//   * Aug 04 20:57:35 `Welcome to level 50!` — the previous ding, which is where the Aug 06
//     drop's window opens (46.6 h wide).
//   * Aug 04 23:38:01 the silent swap into PAL/MNK/ENC (all three capped, so no ding).
//   * Aug 05 20:48:20 `You have slain Lord Nagafen!` at Solo 4 — the kill the ticket is about.
//     Not in the fixture (this extractor keeps class evidence only); the test states its
//     timestamp and joins a recorded kill to the intervals, which is what the surface does.
//   * Aug 06 19:31:23 the NON-INCREASING ding into the level-11 wizard, and the evening that
//     follows it (level 25 by 22:27:32).
//   * Aug 08 the swap BACK to PAL/MNK/ENC, which dings for nothing — going back up to 50 is not
//     a level GAIN — so only the evidence dates it.
//   * Aug 09 10:41:31 `[50 PAL/MNK/ENC] Primitive` — the game stating the loadout on the far
//     side, the anchor the whole arc is measured against.
// It cannot be trimmed at either end: cut the tail and the swap-back disappears (which is CW5),
// cut the head and the ding that opens the absorbed window is gone.
