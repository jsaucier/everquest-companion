# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Inputs.
#
# Anything that would embed an ACCOUNT ID in a committed file has NO default and
# must be passed at apply time (`-var` or a gitignored *.auto.tfvars). This repo
# is public; an account id in git is a free gift to anyone probing.
#
# Every knob that bounds spend is a variable so a flood can be answered by an
# apply instead of an edit — but the defaults are the designed values and should
# not be raised casually.
